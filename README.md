# Umbrella Customizer

This project is a web-based umbrella customization application developed as part of an assignment. It allows users to personalize umbrellas by selecting different colors and uploading custom logos for instant preview.

## Features

* **Umbrella Color Selection:** Users can choose from predefined umbrella colors (Pink, Yellow, Blue). The background color and UI elements update dynamically based on the selected umbrella color.
* **Logo Upload:** Users can upload a logo image in PNG or JPEG format (up to 5MB). The logo is previewed on the umbrella after a simulated loading animation.
* **Loading Animation:** When uploading a logo or switching umbrella colors with a logo already uploaded, a loading spinner is displayed to simulate processing time.

## Technologies Used

* Vanilla JavaScript for interaction and file handling
* HTML and CSS for layout and styling
* Basic DOM manipulation and event handling for dynamic UI updates
